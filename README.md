# 🏡 Analyzing Mortgage Lending Trends in New York (HMDA Data)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores mortgage lending trends across **New York** using the **2015 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) dataset**. The analysis focuses on **loan approvals, denials, and key factors affecting mortgage decisions**, providing valuable insights into lending patterns, disparities, and financial inclusivity.

## 📊 Key Insights from the Analysis

### 🔍 Loan Approval and Denial Insights
- ✅ **Approval Rate**: Only **55.72% of applications** were approved, indicating strict lending policies or applicant ineligibility.
- ❌ **Top Denial Reasons**:
  - **Debt-to-Income Ratio (27.9%)**
  - **Credit History (24.1%)**
  - **Collateral Issues (19.6%)**
  - These three factors **account for over 70% of loan denials**.

### 📍 Geographic Insights
- **Counties with the Highest Denial Rates**:  
  - **Schoharie County** and **Orleans County** had the **highest rejection percentages**.
  - **Urban counties like Queens and Bronx** also show **significant denial rates**, likely due to **housing affordability and income constraints**.
- **Urban vs. Rural Lending**:
  - Mortgage denial rates tend to be **higher in urban clusters**, particularly around **New York City**, possibly due to **stricter affordability assessments**.

### 💲 Debt-to-Income (DTI) Analysis
- **DTI Threshold**:
  - A majority of applicants remain below the industry standard of **43% DTI**, yet high DTI remains a **leading reason for denial**.
- **DTI Distribution**:
  - A **spike in applications with low DTI values (<20%)** suggests many applicants are **financially cautious**, yet still face challenges in securing loans.

### 🏠 Loan Type Trends
- **Conventional Loans Dominate**:
  - The majority of loans originated are **conventional**, with **significantly fewer FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed loans**.
  - **FHA-insured loans** serve as **critical financial support for low-income applicants**.

### 🔍 Race-Based Loan Denial Trends
- **Higher Denial Rates**:
  - Applicants identifying as **American Indian or Alaska Native** and **Black or African American** experience **higher loan rejection rates**.
- **Income Disparities**:
  - A key contributing factor is **lower average income levels** among certain racial groups, which impact mortgage approval outcomes.

### ⬆️ Annual Income and Mortgage Accessibility
- **Income Matters**:
  - **High-income applicants** are **significantly more likely** to secure loans.
  - **Lower-income applicants face disproportionate denials**, underscoring the role of financial capacity in mortgage approvals.
